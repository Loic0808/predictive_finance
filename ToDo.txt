1) Look if there is 15 min available data
2) Implement the following logic: 
    -get historical data of a certain interval [t1, t2] (in the past) to be able to compute EMA and other indicators
    -on the remaining interval [t2, now] run the algorithm like I did it with the Yf data (i.e. with available data and all). If there is a buy command before current time, ignore it and restart. Else we stay in 
     the strategy
    -If we arrive to current time we need an asyncio function and then we read data once it is available and we continue with the current implementation
3) Implement buy and sell functions from Alpaca
4) Test with Yfinance class to see if I have the same results

Questions: If there is only 1 min data available, how much data do I take? can I make it 15 min intervals?
