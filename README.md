# Roadmap to Saas platform

Important reminder, break these steps down into small pieces, don't do all at once.

### **Requirements and Goals**
   - **Target Audience:**\
        -Small traders which want to improve their trading\
        -Support professional traders in their activities\
        -Provide financial support to small companies, help them manage their finances\
        -Larger financial industries like banks and hedge funds, provide them with the strong algorithms. 
   - **Core Features:** \
        -Make difficult mathematical and machine learning tools available for all in the finance domain.\
        -Diverse financial algorithms based on mathematics and machine learning, like trading algorithms, large language model for sentiment analysis, hedging and portfolio managment and (large) data analysis algorithms. \
        -Possibility to use the algorithms directly on the Saas or to use them in the provided environments if already present.\
        -Connect with multiple brokers, modular classes.
   - **Technology Stack:** \
        Python for algoprithms, rest not clear yet. Python, Django/Flask for the backend? React/Vue for the frontend?

## Steps

### 1. **Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
   - **Basic Functionality:**\ 
        Basic versions of algorithms and essential features at the beginning.\
        -Implement a deep reinforcement learning trading algorithm\
        -A mathematical trading strategy\
        -A LLM for market sentiment analysis, which suggest in which stocks to invest\
        -Deep hedging or deep portfolio \
        -A backtesting function which allows to test the performance of the trading bots
   - **Local Development Environment:** Set up a local development environment to build and test algorithms and integrations.

### 2. **Backend Development**
   - **Algorithm Integration:** Develop and test algorithms locally. Connect them to the brokers so that they can interact with the market.
   - **Scheduler Implementation:** Implement a job scheduler (e.g., Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ) to run  algorithms at specified times.
   - **API Development:** Create an API to expose algorithms' functionalities with frameworks like Django REST Framework or Flask-RESTful.

### 3. **Frontend Development**
   - **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for users to interact with SaaS. Use modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization (e.g., using JWT).

### 4. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for algorithms and other backend functionalities.
   - **Integration Testing:** Ensure algorithms work correctly with the external API.
   - **End-to-End Testing:** Test the complete workflow from the frontend to the backend and external API interactions.

### 5. **Deployment**
   - **Choose a Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean. Start with a smaller plan and scale up as needed.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).

### 6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging (e.g., using ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana) to track the performance and errors.
   - **Scheduled Maintenance:** Plan for regular updates and maintenance windows

### 7. **Scaling**
   - **Optimize Algorithms:** Continuously improve algorithms for performance and efficiency.
   - **Load Balancing:** Implement load balancing to handle increased traffic and distribute the workload (e.g., using NGINX, HAProxy).

### ToDo:

1. **Planning and Setup:**
   - **Market Research:** Understand market and competitors.
   - **Documentation:** Document all requirements, user stories, and technical specifications.

2. **Initial Development:**
   - **Local Setup:** Set up development environment.
   - **Version Control:** Use Git for version control.

3. **Backend:**
   - **API Integration:** Implement API calls to the external service, considering the time restrictions.
   - **Database:** Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user data, algorithm results, etc.

4. **Frontend:**
   - **Basic UI:** Create basic UI components.
   - **API Integration:** Connect frontend with backend APIs.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - **Local Testing:** Test algorithms and API integrations locally.
   - **Mocking APIs:** Use mocking tools to simulate API responses during testing.

6. **Deployment and Scaling:**
   - **Initial Deployment:** Deploy your MVP to the cloud.
   - **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle expected traffic.
