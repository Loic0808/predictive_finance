The idea of the backtesting bots is the following: regardless of the type of bot (deep reinforcement learning,
strategy as code,...) we have a class with a certain number of features that we want, which we implemengt in the 
form of class methods. All bots share these features and they allow to access information about the trades, for 
backtesting and also for transparency. 

In addition to this, in the backtesting folder, we have the run backtest functions which allow to run the bots on 
historical data and to give the information about the performance.
